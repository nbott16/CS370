In this project we were given a base code and had to update the Q-training algorithm to find the best possible navigation sequence that results in reaching the treasure cell while maximizing the reward.
Computer scientists develop programs that run our everyday life, whether it is something basic like using a calculator or soemthign advanced like AI a computer scientist has made it at some point. If I run into a problem I will research it to see if anybody has had similar problem then try to come up with a solution.
Our ethical responsibillites are to create programs that are unbiased and will progress humanity and our society in a positive way and try to keep sensitive information secure.
